# blackjack
Simple blackjack game created using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The code is not the cleanest yet but it functions well as far as I can tell.

How to try it on your own computer:

1) download files (index.html and static.zip)
2) save index.html in desired folder
3) unzip the static.zip in the folder where index.html is saved
4) open index.html in your browser (e.g. open Chrome Browser, press control+o, find and open index.html
5) enjoy :)

Future improvements (in no particular order):

1) Translate functional variables to JSON
2) Split gameplay attribute to split if delt 2 of the same cards (e.g. two aces)
3) Money & Beting
4) Cleaning up the code
5) Audio sound effects and music
6) How to play
